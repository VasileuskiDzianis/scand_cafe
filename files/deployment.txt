or from: by_scand_test_task\files\

2) Put file testtask.war from directory by_scand_test_task\target\
into your tomcat\webapps\ directory and run it or use pom.xml for assembly project in your IDE.

additionally

If you need to change rules of calculating order's price you
can make new implementation of two classes BusinessRules and 
BusinessRulesDao and correct dependencies in cost_calculation.xml
without whole recompiling.
